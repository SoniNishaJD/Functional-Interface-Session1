In this example:

MyFunctionalInterface is a functional interface with a single abstract method myMethod.
The @FunctionalInterface annotation indicates that MyFunctionalInterface is intended to be a functional interface.
In the main method, a lambda expression (input) -> System.out.println("Input: " + input) is used to implement the myMethod of the functional interface.
Finally, the myFunc.myMethod("Hello, World!"); statement calls the myMethod using the lambda implementation, which prints "Input: Hello, World!".
Functional interfaces are fundamental in Java's support for functional programming paradigms, enabling the use of lambda expressions and promoting concise and expressive code.
